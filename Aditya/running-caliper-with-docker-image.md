# Running Caliper with a Docker Image: 

We need to create an infrastructure, i.e. a network/ a network configuration having endorsers, orderers, peers and workers (clients), and then connect this network using connections to the caliper. 


# Difficulties: 
This would require creating a ccp (Connection Profiles) and a deep understanding of caliper and fabric network creation. `SOLUTION: MEDIUM/ ONLINE ARTICLE ON THIS TOPIC ARE REALLY HELPFUL`.

- Understanding of Docker (advanced)

## Current Status: 
- I have the docker images of various Fabric components. 
- We have to create the connection profiles and all the directory of the `caliper-workspace` directory like I had created following the Calier setup tutorial for Fabric.
